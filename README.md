[![Built With Ratatui](https://ratatui.rs/built-with-ratatui/badge.svg)](https://ratatui.rs/)

**A modern line editor for Bash, zsh, and fish.**


[![Demo](https://github.com/conall88/flyline-multishell/releases/download/assets/demo_overview.gif)](https://github.com/HalFrgrd/evp)

</div>

> **Note:** `flyline-multishell` is a fork of [flyline](https://github.com/HalFrgrd/flyline) that adds support for additional shell backends (the original project supports Bash only). The CLI command, loadable builtin, standalone binary, environment variables, and config paths all remain named `flyline` / `flyline-standalone` / `FLYLINE_*` — you still type `flyline` in your shell.

Flyline replaces the host shell's default line editor with a richer editing experience:

- **Bash:** loadable builtin that replaces [readline](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Command-Line-Editing.html) in-process
- **zsh / fish:** `flyline-standalone` process driven by a small widget (`scripts/flyline.zsh` / `scripts/flyline.fish`)

Features include:
- [Intellisense style autosuggestions](#intellisense-style-auto-suggestions)
- Change directory using your prompt
- [Rich prompt customizations, (asynchronous widgets), and animations](#rich-prompts)
- [Fuzzy history searching](#command-history)
- [Mouse support (click to move cursor, select text)](#mouse-support)
- [Improvements to tab completion](#tab-completion-improvements)
- [Synthesize tab completion suggestions](#automatic-completion-synthesis-flycomp) with [flycomp](https://github.com/HalFrgrd/flycomp)
- [Agent assisted command writing](#agent-mode)
- Tooltips
- Text selection
- Auto close brackets and quotes
- Syntax highlighting
- [Cursor animations and styles](#cursor-animations-and-styles)

Want another shell? The host-specific bits live behind the [`ShellBackend`](src/shell/mod.rs) trait — see [Adding a shell](#adding-a-shell).

Flyline is similar to [ble.sh](https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh) but is written in Rust and uses [ratatui.rs](https://ratatui.rs/) to more easily draw complex user interfaces.

### Who is it for?
1. You want an out-of-the-box great shell experience without the hassle of setting up half a dozen plugins, plugin managers, keyboard shortcuts, and startup scripts (any one of which might phone home).
2. You're a terminal power user who wants to fine-tune their shell experience by writing in a modern language like Rust. Flyline can be the starting platform for you; [contributions welcome](https://github.com/conall88/flyline-multishell/issues)!

# Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After installing, run `flyline run-tutorial` and if you don't like the mouse capturing: `flyline mouse --mode disabled`

### Quick install

Run the installer from the latest stable release:

```bash
curl -sSfL https://github.com/conall88/flyline-multishell/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sh
```

The installer selects the correct archive, verifies its checksum, and
configures Bash, zsh, and fish when available. No `sudo` is required. See the
[releases page](https://github.com/conall88/flyline-multishell/releases) for
specific versions and release notes.

Set channel env vars on `sh`, not only on `curl`:

```bash
# Newest published product prerelease (never a dev-* snapshot)
curl -sSfL https://github.com/conall88/flyline-multishell/releases/latest/download/install.sh | FLYLINE_CHANNEL=prerelease sh

# Newest published development snapshot
curl -sSfL https://github.com/conall88/flyline-multishell/releases/latest/download/install.sh | FLYLINE_CHANNEL=dev sh
```

`FLYLINE_INSTALL_VERSION=<tag>` pins a specific release and wins over the channel.
`releases/latest` still skips prereleases, so the default one-liner stays on stable.

On macOS, zsh works with the system shell. To use the Bash builtin too, install
a newer Bash that supports custom builtins: `brew install bash`.

#### Zsh integration details

The same `install.sh` also sets up zsh when `zsh` is on your `PATH`: it installs `flyline-standalone` and `libflyline.so` under `~/.local/lib` (or `FLYLINE_INSTALL_DIR`), drops `scripts/flyline.zsh` there, and adds a guarded block to `~/.zshrc`:

```text
# >>> flyline start >>>
export FLYLINE_BIN="$HOME/.local/lib/flyline-standalone"
[[ -r "$HOME/.local/lib/scripts/flyline.zsh" ]] && . "$HOME/.local/lib/scripts/flyline.zsh"
# <<< flyline end <<<
```

Before the first edit, your existing `~/.zshrc` is copied to `~/.zshrc.flyline.bak.TIMESTAMP`. Re-running the installer is idempotent: it will not duplicate the marker block.

**Enable / disable (current shell):**

```zsh
flyline_enable    # turn flyline on (already on after install)
flyline_disable   # restore native ZLE for this session
```

**Uninstall:**

```zsh
flyline_uninstall   # disable flyline and unset FLYLINE_BIN in this zsh session
```

```sh
sh install.sh --uninstall   # remove installed files plus Bash, zsh, and fish startup integration
```

The script reports exactly what it removed. Restart existing shells (or run the
commands it prints) to unload commands that are already in memory.

**Fail-open:** flyline runs as a separate process from a `zle-line-init` hook. If the binary is missing, you cancel, or flyline crashes, zsh falls back to native line editing for that line — your shell keeps working.

**Completions reuse your zsh setup.** flyline drives a persistent headless zsh that loads your `~/.zshrc`, so it completes exactly what your interactive zsh does — oh-my-zsh plugins, `compinit` functions on your `fpath`, and anything you `source`. flyline does not invent completions: if a tool isn't set up to complete in your own zsh, it won't complete in flyline either. For example, `kubectl <Tab>` works only if your zsh actually configures it (add `kubectl` to your oh-my-zsh `plugins=(…)`, or `source <(kubectl completion zsh)` in `~/.zshrc`); once it does, flyline shows the same subcommands and descriptions. kubectl's warm latency (~400ms) is mostly its own API round-trip and matches native zsh.

**`FLYLINE_ZSH_NO_RCS=1`** makes flyline's helper shells skip your `~/.zshrc` (a pristine `zsh -f`). Boot is faster and more predictable, but you lose user/plugin completions (only system `fpath` completions remain). Use it if a heavy prompt framework misbehaves headlessly.

##### Zsh limitations

- **History is file-mediated.** The widget runs `fc -AI` to flush the current session's history to `$HISTFILE` before launching flyline, which then reads the file — recent commands are visible, but this is not a live read of the parent shell's in-memory list.
- **One-time rc boot cost.** Loading a heavy `~/.zshrc` (e.g. powerlevel10k) adds ~1–2s when the completion daemon first starts; the persistent daemon amortizes it across the session. `FLYLINE_ZSH_NO_RCS=1` avoids it.
- **Variable introspection is partial.** Variable tooltips and `$VAR` completion use a per-call `zsh -f`, so they see exported environment variables but not unexported shell parameters.

#### Fish integration details

The same `install.sh` also sets up fish when `fish` is on your `PATH`: it installs `flyline-standalone` under `~/.local/lib` (or `FLYLINE_INSTALL_DIR`), drops `scripts/flyline.fish` there, and writes a loader to `~/.config/fish/conf.d/flyline.fish` (fish auto-sources `conf.d` — your `config.fish` is never touched):

```fish
# >>> flyline start >>>
set -gx FLYLINE_BIN "$HOME/.local/lib/flyline-standalone"
test -r "$HOME/.local/lib/scripts/flyline.fish"; and source "$HOME/.local/lib/scripts/flyline.fish"
# <<< flyline end <<<
```

**Enable / disable (current shell):**

```fish
flyline_enable    # turn flyline on (already on after install)
flyline_disable   # restore native fish line editing for this session
```

**Uninstall:**

```fish
flyline_uninstall   # disable flyline and unset FLYLINE_BIN in this session
```

```sh
sh install.sh --uninstall   # remove conf.d/flyline.fish, flyline-standalone, and scripts/flyline.fish
```

**Start with Enter:** at an empty fish prompt, press Enter to open flyline. If you have already typed into fish's native buffer, Enter retains its normal execute behavior. If the flyline binary is missing, fish also falls back to its native Enter binding.

**Completions reuse your fish setup.** flyline asks `fish -c 'complete --do-complete=…'` for completions, so it completes exactly what your interactive fish does — including descriptions — with your config and completion files loaded. Unlike zsh, fish exposes its completion engine headlessly, so there is no persistent daemon or broker: each request is a fresh ~10–30ms `fish` call.

**Prompts come pre-rendered.** fish prompts are functions, so the widget captures `fish_prompt`/`fish_right_prompt` output (ANSI included) and hands it to flyline — starship, tide, and hand-rolled prompts all work without special-casing.

**flycomp** uses fish's native completion dialect (`OutputFormat::Fish`) and writes to `~/.config/fish/completions/<cmd>.fish`. Because each Tab already runs a fresh `fish -c`, writing the file is enough to activate it (no daemon reload).

##### Fish limitations

- **History is file-mediated.** The widget runs `history save` before launching flyline, which then reads the session's history file — recent commands are visible, but this is not a live read of the parent shell's in-memory list.
- **Variable introspection is partial.** Variable tooltips and `$VAR` completion use a per-call `fish -c`, so they see exported and universal variables but not unexported globals of the parent session.
- **Abbreviations don't expand inline.** `abbr` expansions are shown as alias tooltips and used for completion lookup, but typing an abbreviation in flyline inserts it literally.
- **fish's prompt-time terminal queries are disabled while flyline is on.** fish 4.x sends blocking terminal queries (cursor position, background color) around each prompt and hard-`assert!`s if one is still pending when the next is issued (`reader.rs`, `query.is_none()`) — a TUI taking the tty consumes the reply under real terminal latency and crashes fish itself (reproduced with ≥300ms reply lag; guarded by a regression test). The integration therefore sets `FISH_TEST_NO_RECURRENT_QUERIES` while enabled and clears it on `flyline_disable`. Practical cost: fish's automatic light/dark background detection pauses while flyline is active. Flyline runs from a fish reader binding so accepted commands—including `sudo`, package managers, and password prompts—retain normal job control and terminal input.

### Arch Linux

The existing [`flyline` AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/flyline)
currently tracks the upstream Bash-only project, not `flyline-multishell`.
Until a fork-specific AUR package is available, use the
[quick install](#quick-install) above to install this fork on Arch Linux.

### Download from releases

Download the archive and matching `.sha256` file for your target from the
[releases page](https://github.com/conall88/flyline-multishell/releases).
Each archive includes the Bash loadable library, the standalone editor binary,
and the zsh/fish integration scripts.

After extracting it:

- Bash: load the versioned `libflyline.so` (`libflyline.dylib` on macOS) with
  `enable -f /path/to/library flyline`.
- zsh: set `FLYLINE_BIN` to the extracted `flyline-standalone` binary and
  source the extracted `scripts/flyline.zsh`.
- fish: set `FLYLINE_BIN` to the extracted `flyline-standalone` binary and
  source the extracted `scripts/flyline.fish` (or copy the conf.d loader from
  the [Fish integration details](#fish-integration-details) section).

For automatic target selection, checksum verification, and shell
configuration, prefer the [quick install](#quick-install).

### Build from source

Clone the repository and build both the Bash library and standalone editor:

```bash
cargo build --features standalone
```

For Bash:

```bash
enable -f /path/to/flyline_checkout/target/debug/libflyline.so flyline
flyline run-tutorial
```

For zsh:

```zsh
export FLYLINE_BIN=/path/to/flyline_checkout/target/debug/flyline-standalone
source /path/to/flyline_checkout/scripts/flyline.zsh
flyline run-tutorial
```

For fish:

```fish
set -gx FLYLINE_BIN /path/to/flyline_checkout/target/debug/flyline-standalone
source /path/to/flyline_checkout/scripts/flyline.fish
flyline run-tutorial
```


<details>
<summary><strong>Installation notes</strong></summary>

Disable flyline with `enable -d flyline`.

#### BASH_LOADABLES_PATH

Taken from https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html:

> The -f option means to load the new builtin command name from shared object filename, on systems that support dynamic loading. If filename does not contain a slash, Bash will use the value of the BASH_LOADABLES_PATH variable as a colon-separated list of directories in which to search for filename. The default for BASH_LOADABLES_PATH is system-dependent, and may include "." to force a search of the current directory.

Bash 4.4 introduced `BASH_LOADABLES_PATH`
Bash 5.2-alpha added a default value for `BASH_LOADABLES_PATH`.
Check your Bash version with: `bash --version`

So on Bash at least as recent as 5.2, if you install flyline to one of:
- /opt/local/lib/bash
- /opt/pkg/lib/bash
- /usr/lib/bash
- /usr/local/lib/bash
- /usr/pkg/lib/bash

Then you can simply run `enable flyline`.

</details>

# Configuration

Flyline sets up its own tab completion
so you can type `flyline <Tab>` in your shell to interactively browse and configure settings. Copy the commands into your `.bashrc` so they persist.

Explore this README and [examples](examples/) for what you can configure.

# Rich prompts

Flyline supports dynamic content in `PS1`, `RPS1` / `RPROMPT`, `PS1_FILL`, and `PS2`.

## PS1
The `PS1` environment variable sets the left prompt just like normal. See [Bash prompt documentation](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Controlling-the-Prompt.html), [Arch Linux wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Bash/Prompt_customization), or [Starship](https://starship.rs/) for more information.
[![PS1 demo](https://github.com/conall88/flyline-multishell/releases/download/assets/demo_prompts_ps1.gif)](https://github.com/HalFrgrd/evp)
```bash
PS1='\u@\h:\w$ '
PS1='\u@\h:\w\n$ '
PS1='\e[01;32m\u@\h\e[00m:\e[01;34m\w\e[00m\n$ '
```

> [!TIP]
> Do git metrics slow down your prompt loading time? See [custom widget](#custom-command-widget) or [example widgets](examples/widgets.sh) for a solution.

## RPS1 / RPROMPT
The `RPS1` / `RPROMPT` variable sets the right prompt similarly to Zsh.
[![RPS1 demo](https://github.com/conall88/flyline-multishell/releases/download/assets/demo_prompts_rps1.gif)](https://github.com/HalFrgrd/evp)
```bash
RPS1='\t'
RPS1='\t\n<'
RPS1='\e[01;33m\t\n<\e[00m'
```

## PS1_FILL
`PS1_FILL` fills the gap between the `PS1` and `RPS1` lines.
[![PS1_FILL demo](https://github.com/conall88/flyline-multishell/releases/download/assets/demo_prompts_ps1_fill.gif)](https://github.com/HalFrgrd/evp)
```bash
PS1_FILL='-'
PS1_FILL='🯁🯂🯃🮲🮳' # finger pointing to running man
PS1_FILL='🯁🯂🯃🮲🮳 \D{%.3f}'
```

## PS2
The `PS2` environment variable configures the multi-line continuation prompt.
`FLYLINE_PROMPT_LINE_NUMBER` will be replaced by the line number:
[![PS2 demo](https://github.com/HalFrgrd/flyline/releases/download/assets/demo_prompts_ps2.gif)](https://github.com/HalFrgrd/evp)
```bash
# Styled line numbers with ANSI color
PS2='\e[2mFLYLINE_PROMPT_LINE_NUMBER>\e[0m '

# Custom prompt prefix with line numbers
PS2='\e[2mline FLYLINE_PROMPT_LINE_NUMBER:\e[0m '

# If you do want the default '> ' prompt, then you want:
PS2='\e[0m> '
```


## Final (transient) prompts
`PS1_FINAL`, `RPS1_FINAL`, and `PS1_FILL_FINAL` let you configure transient prompts. When a command is submitted, Flyline performs a final redraw using these environment variables instead of their standard counterparts. This keeps your terminal scrollback history clean by replacing complex, multi-line prompts with a minimal version.

[![Final prompts demo](https://github.com/conall88/flyline-multishell/releases/download/assets/demo_prompts_final.gif)](https://github.com/HalFrgrd/evp)
```bash
PS1_FINAL='Ran at \D{%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S}> '
RPS1_FINAL=''
PS1_FILL_FINAL=''
```

## Dynamic time in prompts

Flyline recognises the standard Bash time escape sequences and re-evaluates them on every prompt draw, so the time shown is always current:

| Sequence       | Output                          |
|----------------|---------------------------------|
| `\t`           | 24-hour time — `HH:MM:SS`       |
| `\T`           | 12-hour time — `HH:MM:SS`       |
| `\@`           | 12-hour time with am/pm         |
| `\A`           | 24-hour time — `HH:MM`          |
| `\D{format}`   | Custom format (see below)       |

These can be placed in any of the supported prompt variables:

```bash
# Right prompt showing 24-hour time in green
RPS1='\e[01;32m\t\e[0m'

# Right prompt showing 12-hour am/pm time
RPS1='\e[01;34m\@\e[0m'
```

### Custom time format with `\D{format}`

Use `\D{format}` with any [Chrono format string](https://docs.rs/chrono/latest/chrono/format/strftime/index.html) to display the time exactly how you want it. This is similar to `\D{format}` in the [Bash prompt documentation](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Controlling-the-Prompt.html), but the format string is interpreted by Chrono rather than strftime.

```bash
# Show date and time
RPS1='\e[01;32m\D{%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S}\e[0m'

# Show only hours and minutes
RPS1='\D{%H:%M}'
```



## Custom prompt widgets

Create custom prompt widgets with `flyline create-prompt-widget`.
Flyline will replace strings in the prompt matching the widget name with the widget's output.
The available widget types are `animation`, `mouse-mode`, `copy-buffer`, `custom`, and `last-command-duration`.

### Animations

Create your own animations with `flyline create-prompt-widget animation --name [your animation name here] [FRAMES]...`.
Flyline will replace strings in the prompt matching the animation name with the animation:

[![Custom animation demo](https://github.com/conall88/flyline-multishell/releases/download/assets/demo_custom_animation.gif)](https://github.com/HalFrgrd/evp)

More examples can be found in [examples/animations.sh](examples/animations.sh).

The block below is auto-generated from `flyline create-prompt-widget animation --help`:

<!-- FLYLINE_CREATE_PROMPT_WIDGET_ANIMATION_HELP_START -->
```
Create a custom prompt animation that cycles through frames.

Instances of NAME in prompt strings (PS1, RPS1, PS1_FILL, and their _FINAL counterparts) are replaced
with the current animation frame on every render.  Frames may include
ANSI colour sequences written as `\e` (e.g. `\e[33m`).

Examples:
  flyline create-prompt-widget animation --name "MY_ANIMATION" --fps 10  ⣾ ⣷ ⣯ ⣟ ⡿ ⢿ ⣻ ⣽
  flyline create-prompt-widget animation --name "john" --ping-pong --fps 5  '\e[33m\u' '\e[31m\u' '\e[35m\u' '\e[36m\u'

See https://github.com/conall88/flyline-multishell/blob/master/examples/animations.sh for more details and example usage.

Usage: flyline create-prompt-widget animation [OPTIONS] --name <NAME> [FRAMES]...

Arguments:
  [FRAMES]...
          One or more animation frames (positional).  Use `\e` for the ESC character

Options:
      --name <NAME>
          Name to embed in prompt strings as the animation placeholder

      --fps <FPS>
          Playback speed in frames per second (default: 10)
          
          [default: 10]

      --ping-pong
          Reverse direction at each end instead of wrapping (ping-pong / bounce mode)

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')
```
<!-- FLYLINE_CREATE_PROMPT_WIDGET_ANIMATION_HELP_END -->

### Mouse-mode widget

The block below is auto-generated from `flyline create-prompt-widget mouse-mode --help`:

<!-- FLYLINE_CREATE_PROMPT_WIDGET_MOUSE_MODE_HELP_START -->
```
Show different text depending on whether mouse capture is enabled.

Instances of NAME in prompt strings (PS1, RPS1, PS1_FILL, and their _FINAL counterparts) are replaced
with ENABLED_TEXT when mouse capture is on, and DISABLED_TEXT when off.

Examples:
  flyline create-prompt-widget mouse-mode '🖱️' '🔴'
  # Now use FLYLINE_MOUSE_MODE in your prompt:
  PS1='\u@\h:\w [FLYLINE_MOUSE_MODE] $ '

  flyline create-prompt-widget mouse-mode --name MOUSE_MODE "on " "off"

Usage: flyline create-prompt-widget mouse-mode [OPTIONS] <ENABLED_TEXT> <DISABLED_TEXT>

Arguments:
  <ENABLED_TEXT>
          Text to display when mouse capture is enabled

  <DISABLED_TEXT>
          Text to display when mouse capture is disabled

Options:
      --name <NAME>
          Name to embed in prompt strings as the widget placeholder. Defaults to `FLYLINE_MOUSE_MODE`
          
          [default: FLYLINE_MOUSE_MODE]

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')
```
<!-- FLYLINE_CREATE_PROMPT_WIDGET_MOUSE_MODE_HELP_END -->

### Copy-buffer widget

Render clickable text in your prompt that copies the current command buffer to the clipboard via OSC 52.

```bash
flyline create-prompt-widget copy-buffer '[copy]'
# Now use FLYLINE_COPY_BUFFER in your prompt:
RPS1=' FLYLINE_COPY_BUFFER'
```

### Custom command widget

The block below is auto-generated from `flyline create-prompt-widget custom --help`:

<!-- FLYLINE_CREATE_PROMPT_WIDGET_CUSTOM_HELP_START -->
```
Run a shell command and display its output in the prompt.

The output is passed through Bash's decode_prompt_string so Bash prompt
escape sequences (e.g. \u, \w, ANSI colour codes) are fully supported.

Examples:
  # Non-blocking (default): runs in the background; shows the previous output
  # while the command is running (empty on the first render).
  flyline create-prompt-widget custom --name CUSTOM_WIDGET1 --command 'run_slow_git_metrics.sh'
  # PS1 usage:
  PS1='\u@\h:\w [CUSTOM_WIDGET1] $ '

  # Non-blocking with previous output placeholder while the new output is being computed.
  flyline create-prompt-widget custom --name CUSTOM_WIDGET1 --command 'run_slow_git_metrics.sh' --placeholder prev

  # Blocking: waits for the command to finish before showing the prompt.
  flyline create-prompt-widget custom --name CUSTOM_WIDGET2 --command 'run_something.sh' --block

  # Blocking with a 500 ms timeout; falls back to placeholder if slower.
  flyline create-prompt-widget custom --name CUSTOM_WIDGET3 --command 'run_slow.sh --flag' --block 500 --placeholder prev

Usage: flyline create-prompt-widget custom [OPTIONS] --name <NAME> --command <COMMAND>

Options:
      --name <NAME>
          Name to embed in prompt strings as the widget placeholder

      --command <COMMAND>
          Command string to run; include any flags in the same string, e.g. --command './widget.sh --someflag'

      --block [<MS>]
          Block until the command finishes, optionally with a timeout in milliseconds. With no value, polls indefinitely (i32::MAX ms ≈ 24.8 days).  If the timeout expires the command continues running in the background and subsequent renders will pick up its output

      --placeholder <PLACEHOLDER>
          What to show while the command is running.  Either a number (spaces) or 'prev' (use the previous output of the command)

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')
```
<!-- FLYLINE_CREATE_PROMPT_WIDGET_CUSTOM_HELP_END -->

### Last-command-duration widget

Show how long ago the flyline app last closed. The duration is displayed in a compact human-readable format, for example `9.2s`, `1m23s`, `1h02m03s`, `1d20h43m`.

```bash
flyline create-prompt-widget last-command-duration
# Now use FLYLINE_LAST_COMMAND_DURATION in your prompt:
RPS1=' FLYLINE_LAST_COMMAND_DURATION'
```


# Agent mode
Flyline can interact with your AI agent to suggest commands.
This allows you to write a command in plain English and your agent will convert it into a Bash command:

[![Agent mode demo](https://github.com/conall88/flyline-multishell/releases/download/assets/demo_agent_mode.gif)](https://github.com/HalFrgrd/evp)

After setting up your agent with flyline, you can pass the buffer to your agent with Alt+Enter or simply Enter when your command starts with your trigger prefix (e.g. `ai: list files older than three days`).

[See the examples for how to set this up](examples/agent_mode.sh). If agent mode is not configured yet, pressing Alt+Enter will prompt flyline to help configure it.

Flyline will syntax highlight the suggested commands and render markdown output.

# Mouse support

Click to move your cursor, select suggestions, and hover for tooltips.
Flyline must capture mouse events for the entire terminal, which isn't always desirable.
For instance, you might want to select text above the current prompt with your mouse.

Flyline offers three mouse modes:
- `disabled`: Never capture mouse events
- `simple`: Mouse capture is on by default; toggled when Escape is pressed
- `smart` (default): Mouse capture is on by default with automatic management: disabled on scroll or when the user clicks above the viewport, re-enabled on any keypress or when focus is regained. You can also toggle it manually with Escape

I'd recommend [setting up a mouse mode widget](#mouse-mode-widget) to know when mouse capture is enabled.

# Tab completion improvements
Flyline extends Bash's tab completion feature in many ways.
Note that you will need to have [set up completions in normal Bash first](https://github.com/scop/bash-completion).


### Intellisense style auto suggestions
Flyline can automatically start tab completion suggestions as you type. This demo shows auto-started suggestions, confirming a suggestion, dismissing with Escape, and submitting the command.

[![Auto tab completion demo](https://github.com/conall88/flyline-multishell/releases/download/assets/demo_auto_tab_completion.gif)](https://github.com/HalFrgrd/evp)

This is similar to [inshellisense](https://github.com/microsoft/inshellisense) but uses Bash's completion system and runs in the same process as Bash.


### Fuzzy tab completion search
When you're presented with suggestions, you can type to fuzzily search through the list:

[![Fuzzy path suggestions demo](https://github.com/conall88/flyline-multishell/releases/download/assets/demo_fuzzy_suggestions.gif)](https://github.com/HalFrgrd/evp)

You can customize the fuzzy matching behavior using the `flyline suggestions set-fuzzy-mode` command. It accepts three options:
- `all` (default): Fuzzy matching is enabled for all completion suggestions.
- `none`: Fuzzy matching is disabled entirely (falling back to case-insensitive prefix matching).
- `folder-prefixes`: Folders are matched using case-insensitive prefix matching while remaining enabled for regular files and other suggestions.

### Fuzzy path completion
The last path segments from the cursor to the end will be fuzzily matched on the directory contents:

[![Fuzzy path suggestions demo](https://github.com/conall88/flyline-multishell/releases/download/assets/demo_fuzzy_path_suggestions.gif)](https://github.com/HalFrgrd/evp)

### Alias expansion
Aliases are expanded before attempting tab completion so that Bash calls the desired completion function.
For instance, if `gc` aliases to `git commit`, `gc --verbo<Tab>` will work as expected.

### Nested command contexts
Flyline supports tab completions inside subshell, command substitution, and process substitution expressions.
For instance, `ls $(grep --<Tab>)` calls `grep`'s tab completion logic if it's set up.

### Dynamic descriptions
If a suggestion contains a tab character, flyline displays the contents after the tab as a description. If there are multiple tab characters, flyline will animate each tab-delimited frame at 24fps. Try `flyline set-cursor --interpolate-easing <Tab>` for an example:

[![Tab completion easing demo](https://github.com/conall88/flyline-multishell/releases/download/assets/demo_tab_completion_easing.gif)](https://github.com/HalFrgrd/evp)


ANSI styling is supported in descriptions: any ANSI colour/style escape codes embedded in the tab-separated description text will be rendered as ratatui styled spans.

Descriptions for files are the time since last modified.

### Automatic completion synthesis (flycomp)
If a command lacks a useful completion script, flyline can invoke [flycomp](https://github.com/HalFrgrd/flycomp) to dynamically synthesize one by parsing its `--help` outputs and man pages. flycomp writes the host shell's dialect (Bash compspec, zsh `compdef`, or fish `complete`).

**Bash:** type the command name, press Tab — flyline prompts you to run flycomp:

[![Automatic completion synthesis demo (Bash)](https://github.com/conall88/flyline-multishell/releases/download/assets/demo_flycomp.gif)](https://github.com/HalFrgrd/evp)

**zsh and fish:** Tab often returns *generic file completions* first, which hides the flycomp offer. Dismiss those with Escape, then press Tab again to get the synthesize prompt:

```text
claude␠ → Esc (dismiss file completions) → Tab → [Yes]
```

[![flycomp on zsh](https://github.com/conall88/flyline-multishell/releases/download/assets/demo_flycomp_zsh.gif)](https://github.com/HalFrgrd/evp)
[![flycomp on fish](https://github.com/conall88/flyline-multishell/releases/download/assets/demo_flycomp_fish.gif)](https://github.com/HalFrgrd/evp)

Flycomp settings are configurable with `flyline suggestions flycomp ...`.

### `LS_COLORS` styling
Flyline styles your filename tab completion results according to `$LS_COLORS`:

# Command history

**Fuzzy history search:**
Flyline offers a fuzzy history search similar to fzf or skim accessed with `Ctrl+R`:

[![Fuzzy history demo](https://github.com/conall88/flyline-multishell/releases/download/assets/demo_fuzzy_history.gif)](https://github.com/HalFrgrd/evp)

You can access a list of commands in the current session that you Ctrl+C'd while editing using `Alt+R`.
This is useful if you start writing a command, realise you want to run another command first, but you don't want to lose your first command.

**Inline suggestions:**
Inline suggestions appear as you type based on the most recent matching history entry. Accept them by moving your cursor to the end of the line and pressing `Right`/`End`.

[![Inline history demo](https://github.com/conall88/flyline-multishell/releases/download/assets/demo_inline_history.gif)](https://github.com/HalFrgrd/evp)

**Scroll through prefix matches:**
Pressing `Up` will scroll through history entries that are a prefix match with the current command.

**Zsh history entries:**
Optionally read Zsh history entries to make migrating to Bash easier.

# Cursor animations and styles

Flyline can configure the cursor styling, color, and interpolation/easing animations. When moving the cursor or deleting/inserting characters, the cursor dynamically slides and animates to its new position.

You can configure the style and animation effects using the `flyline set-cursor` command:

[![Cursor style demo](https://github.com/conall88/flyline-multishell/releases/download/assets/demo_cursor_style.gif)](https://github.com/HalFrgrd/evp)

For example, to configure a custom color with elastic interpolation and fade effects:
```bash
flyline set-cursor --backend flyline --style "#33ccff" --effect fade --effect-easing in-out-sine --interpolate-easing out-elastic --interpolate 2
```

To see all available options (such as terminal-native cursor backends or other easing equations):
```bash
flyline set-cursor --help
```

# Terminal emulator notes

Flyline makes use modern terminal features / escape codes.
I'd recommend a feature complete terminal emulator like Ghostty or Kitty.
You can check https://vtdn.dev/ to see what features your terminal emulator / multiplexer supports.

## Ghostty
I recommend setting `cursor-click-to-move = false`.
When this is `true`, incorrect mouse events are sent to flyline. 

## Kitty:
When running inside Kitty, it is highly recommended to use the terminal cursor backend:
```bash
flyline set-cursor --backend terminal
```
By default, Flyline detects if it is running in Kitty and defaults to the `terminal` backend. Using the custom `flyline` cursor backend inside Kitty hides the terminal's native hardware cursor, which prevents Kitty from detecting shell prompts, causing it to ask for confirmation when closing the terminal window.

## VS Code:
Recommended settings
- [`terminal.integrated.minimumContrastRatio = 1`](vscode://settings/terminal.integrated.minimumContrastRatio) to prevent the cell's foreground colour changing when it's under the cursor.
- You may want to set [`terminal.integrated.macOptionIsMeta`](vscode://settings/terminal.integrated.macOptionIsMeta) so `Option+<KEY>` shortcuts are properly recognised.
- Enable [`terminal.integrated.enableKittyKeyboardProtocol`](vscode://settings/terminal.integrated.enableKittyKeyboardProtocol) so that the integrated terminal [correctly forwards keystrokes to flyline](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_109#_new-vt-features). You will need to set [`workbench.settings.alwaysShowAdvancedSettings = 1`](vscode://settings/workbench.settings.alwaysShowAdvancedSettings) to find this setting.
- Enable [`terminal.integrated.textBlinking`](vscode://terminal.integrated.textBlinking). Few terminal emulators support this neat text style option so enjoy it!
- If keybindings are not working properly, you can debug by [Toggling Keyboard Shortcuts Troubleshooting](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/keybindings#_troubleshooting-keyboard-shortcuts).

I find that Copilot can't interact with the terminal if flyline runs with certain settings. If you run into this problem, add this to the end of your `.bashrc`:
```bash
if [[ -n "${COPILOT_TERMINAL:-}" ]]; then
    RPS1=''
    flyline set-cursor --backend terminal --interpolate none
    flyline editor --show-inline-history false
    flyline suggestions --auto-suggest false
fi
``` 
and set this in your `settings.json`:
```json
  "chat.tools.terminal.terminalProfile.linux": {
    "env": {
      "COPILOT_TERMINAL": "1"
    },
    "path": "bash",
  }
```

## macOS

`Command+<KEY>` shortcuts are often captured by the terminal emulator and not forwarded to the shell.
Two possible fixes are:
- Map `Command+<KEY>` to `Control+<KEY>` in your terminal emulator settings.
- Use a terminal emulator that supports [Kitty's extended keyboard protocol](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/keyboard-protocol/). This allows flyline to receive `Command+<KEY>` events.

## Shell integration
Flyline prints [OSC 133](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/shell-integration/#notes-for-shell-developers) and [OSC 633](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration#_supported-escape-sequences) escape codes to integrate the shell with the terminal. These are on by default and can be disabled with `flyline --send-shell-integration-codes none`.

## Colour palette

Flyline ships with two built-in colour presets (dark and light) and lets you override individual colours.

### Presets

```bash
flyline set-style --default-theme dark   # original palette, optimised for dark terminals
flyline set-style --default-theme light  # preset optimised for light terminals
```

### Custom colours

Style strings follow the [rich](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/style.html) syntax: a
space-separated list of attributes and colours.

Supported attributes: `bold`, `dim`, `italic`, `underline`, `blink`, `reverse`, `strike`.

Colours can be specified by name (`red`, `green`, `blue`, `magenta`, `cyan`, `yellow`,
`white`, `black`, `bright_red`, …), as a 256-colour index (`color(196)`), or as an RGB
hex code (`#ff5500`) or `rgb(r,g,b)` form.

```bash
flyline set-style inline-suggestion="dim italic"
flyline set-style --default-theme light matching-char="bold blue"
flyline set-style recognised-command="green" unrecognised-command="bold red"
flyline set-style secondary-text="dim" tutorial-hint="bold italic"
flyline set-style bash-reserved="bold yellow"
```

## Keybindings

Flyline allows configurable keybindings with the `flyline key bind [KEY SEQUENCE] [CONTEXT_EXPR]=[ACTIONS]` subcommand:
- `CONTEXT_EXPR` is a `+`-separated chain of **context variables** (each optionally prefixed with `!` to negate).
- `ACTIONS` is a `+`-separated chain of **actions**.
- A binding only fires when its **context expression** evaluates to true.
- This allows the same key sequence to trigger different **actions** under different circumstances.

For instance:
```bash
flyline key bind Enter always=submitOrNewline
flyline key bind Enter tabCompletionAvailable=tabCompletionAcceptEntry  # defined last -> higher priority
```
When you press `Enter`, flyline will accept the tab completion entry if `tabCompletionAvailable` is true (i.e. you are currently browsing tab completion suggestions).
If `tabCompletionAvailable` is false, then it will try the next keybinding for `Enter` and run that action if its context expression evaluates to true.
The `always` context variable is always true.
For tab completion, `tabCompletionOneResult` is true when there is exactly one tab completion result.

Flyline provides useful tab completions to help you write keybindings.

#### List keybindings
List all keybindings with `flyline key list`.
List bindings for a single key event with: `flyline key list Ctrl+a`

#### Context expressions
A context expression may combine multiple variables with `+`:
```bash
flyline key bind Tab inlineSuggestionAvailable+cursorAtEnd=inlineSuggestionAccept
```
This will only trigger when *both* `inlineSuggestionAvailable` and `cursorAtEnd` are true.
Use `!` in front of a variable to negate it (e.g. `!textSelected`). Parentheses are not supported. 

#### Multiple actions
Multiple actions can be dispatched from a single key event:
```bash
flyline key bind Ctrl+g always=clearBuffer+prevHistoryEntry+submitOrNewLine

# You can setup "macros":
flyline key bind Ctrl+g 'always=clearBuffer+insertString(yazi)+submitOrNewline'

# NB: Single quotes are needed here to avoid Bash syntax errors
flyline key bind Ctrl+g 'always=clearBuffer+insertString(git checkout -b )'
```

`clearBuffer+insertString(some command)+submitOrNewline` is a handy pattern of actions to quickly run `some command`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `submitOrNewline` will cause flyline to accept a well formed command.
> Any actions after flyline accepts the buffer are dropped.

#### Full key event remap

It is possible to remap individual keys and full key events entirely with:
```bash
# Individual key
flyline key remap Alt Ctrl       # Pressing Alt now acts like pressing Ctrl
flyline key remap Ctrl Alt       # With the above command, Alt and Ctrl are effectively swapped

# Full key event
flyline key remap Ctrl+P Up      # Pressing Ctrl+P will trigger any keybinding that Up would trigger
```

Q: Why would you use key event remapping?

A: Instead of manually duplicating multiple context-dependent bindings from `Up` to `Ctrl+P` , you can use key event remapping to redirect `Ctrl+p` to `Up`  globally.

#### Leader Keys

> [!CAUTION]
> This an experimental feature and might change. Feedback welcome

Flyline supports leader key sequences. A leader key sequence allows you to press a prefix key (like `Ctrl+x`), which activates a temporary leader key state (for up to 1000ms). While that state is active, you can press a subsequent key to trigger a specific binding.

To set up leader key bindings:
```bash
# Bind the prefix key to `setLeaderKey`**:
flyline key bind Ctrl+x always=setLeaderKey

# Ctrl+x then Ctrl+f clears the buffer, inserts "git status", and runs it
flyline key bind Ctrl+f 'leaderKeyActive=clearBuffer+insertString(git status)+submitOrNewline'

# Ctrl+x then g clears buffer, then inserts "git commit -m", and consumes the leader key
flyline key bind g 'leaderKeyActive=clearBuffer+insertString(git commit -m)+unsetLeaderKey'

# Or we could set the leader key again to chain leader key lead actions:
flyline key bind g 'leaderKeyActive=clearBuffer+insertString(git commit -m)+setLeaderKey'
```

To show a visual indicator in your prompt (e.g. `<leader>` or ` X `) when the leader key state is active, register a `leader-mode` prompt widget:
```bash
# This will show "LEADER" when active and nothing inactive
flyline create-prompt-widget leader-mode --name FLYLINE_LEADER_MODE 'LEADER' ''

# And include it in your `PS1`/`RPS1`/`PS1_FILL`:
export RPS1='FLYLINE_LEADER_MODE'
```

# Integration with third party apps
> [!CAUTION]
> This an experimental feature and might change. Feedback welcome

Flyline completely replaces readline so other TUIs that help you write commands don't work immediately.

Flyline has a special action that will:
- pause flyline then
- run your program then
- wait for it to finish (keyboard / mouse are handled by your program) then
- flyline resumes and update the buffer based on `READLINE_LINE`, `READLINE_POINT`, and `READLINE_MARK`.

This is **Bash-only**. zsh and fish hosts do not expose readline's `READLINE_*` variables; `runBashCommand` will not drive Atuin/fzf on those shells.

## Atuin
```bash
eval "$(atuin init bash)"
flyline key bind Ctrl+r 'always=runBashCommand(__atuin_widget_run)+submitOrNewline' 
flyline key bind Up 'editingBufferMode+cursorOnFirstLine=runBashCommand("__atuin_history --shell-up-key-binding --keymap-mode=emacs")+submitOrNewline'
flyline key bind 'Char(?)' 'editingBufferMode+bufferIsEmpty=runBashCommand(_atuin_ai_question_mark)'
```

## fzf
```bash
eval "$(fzf --bash)"

flyline_fzf_cd() {
    local cmd
    cmd=$(__fzf_cd__) && READLINE_LINE="$cmd" READLINE_POINT=${#cmd}
}

flyline key bind Ctrl+r 'always=runBashCommand(__fzf_history__)' # or runBashCommand(__fzf_history__)+submitOrNewline
flyline key bind Ctrl+t 'always=runBashCommand(fzf-file-widget)'
flyline key bind Alt+c  'always=runBashCommand(flyline_fzf_cd)+submitOrNewline'
```

## Custom

```bash
# 1. Define the function
my_custom_function() {
    local line="$READLINE_LINE"
    local point="${READLINE_POINT:-0}"
    local mark="${READLINE_MARK:-0}"

    local start=$(( point < mark ? point : mark ))
    local end=$(( point > mark ? point : mark ))
    local len=$(( end - start ))

    local selected="${line:start:len}"
    local prefix="this part was selected: "

    READLINE_LINE="${prefix}${selected}"
    READLINE_MARK=${#prefix}
    READLINE_POINT=$(( ${#prefix}  + ${#selected}  ))
}

# 2. Bind it to a key combination (e.g., Ctrl+b)
flyline key bind Ctrl+b 'always=runBashCommand(my_custom_function)'
```

# Adding a shell

Host-specific behavior is isolated behind [`ShellBackend`](src/shell/mod.rs). Bash (`BashBackend`), zsh (`src/shell/zsh.rs`), and fish (`src/shell/fish.rs`) already implement it. To add another shell:

1. Implement `ShellBackend` (completions, history, env/vars, flycomp dialect + write path, …).
2. Add a small host widget that launches `flyline-standalone` (see `scripts/flyline.zsh` / `scripts/flyline.fish`).
3. Wire install (`install.sh`), release packaging, and a Docker integration test (mirror the zsh/fish bake targets).

PRs that stay close to those patterns are easiest to review and keep mergeable with upstream.
